    description: 'MAST was a large scale AngularJS project BAE Systems Applied Intelligence delivered for Lloyd\'s Register.',
    productSummary: 'At a basic level MAST is essentially an MOT application that Lloyd\'s Register surveyors would use to survey all maritime vehicles, whether that be commercial or government. Not everything Lloydâ€™s Register provides certificates for can be docked, due to this a key feature of MAST was that surveys could be conducted offline whilst out at sea.',
    myRole: 'MAST was my first venture into Software Development. I started as an apprentice being thrown into the deep-end, working as a front-end developer on one of many Scrum teams. Initially I focused on bug fixes within the defect team. This provided me the perfect opportunity to develop my debugging skills whilst expanding my JavaScript and AngularJs knowledge.\n \n It wasn\'t too long before I was able to join a feature team giving me the opportunity to learn from the experienced developers around me on how to plan my work and code for the next developer. As there was a strong focus on every member of the team having a voice, I gained extensive experience in Scrum and was expected to run various ceremonies.\n \n Over time as my knowledge and experience grew, I became the front-end lead on MAST supporting, guiding and mentoring junior members of the team. I was expected to provide solutions to client-side problems whilst working closely with the Engineering Manager and Architect to plan upcoming work.',

This information could have been the previously created certificates generated in MAST or it could have been when the next survey was scheduled.',
    myRole: 'When I inherited the lead Front-end developer responsibilities of MAST, we as a team also inherited the project "Class Direct" from a team in Kuala Lumpur. Similarly to MAST, my role was to support junior members of the team whilst helping plan, design and implement features alongside fixing bugs.\n\nClass Direct used a combination of AngularJJ, Pug, no knowledge transfer and little to no warning that the project was coming. Due to this, we had the interesting task of bringing ourselves up to speed with the codebase and its capabilities. The benefit of working on Class Direct and MAST at the same time was that I could now see the full picture of what BAE had been delivering for Lloyd\'s Register.',

As Dynamo is only designed to give points via walking, running and cycling, an anti-cheat system was also developed.',

Originally v3 was developed to be a feature parity successor to v2, although this time built from the ground up with React Native instead of Sky\'s internally developed custom language/library.\n\nTo enable Sky\'s ambition to become App first, the purpose of MSA was to assist customers with all their needs and help ease the pressure on call centres. MSA is a hub for customers to manage all their Sky needs, whether that is TV, Mobile or Broadband. There is also a huge drive for personalisation using Adobe Target to provide a personalised experience per customer.',

As it should be within any development team, I also had the responsibility of supporting the other developers in their development journey.\n\nSky was migrating much of their content from an MSAv2 specific stack in Content Stack over to the company wide one, something I had a vast amount of experience with. I quickly jumped at the opportunity to share my experience, knowledge and tips with the Tech Leads, something that then resulted in me being one four people with full write access and the only non Tech Lead.\n\nAfter we delivered MSAv3 to the public we moved away from feature parity and started to introduce personalised experiences for customers.
