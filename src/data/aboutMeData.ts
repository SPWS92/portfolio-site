    description: 'September 2014 I was a successful candidate for the Apprenticeship Scheme at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence. As part of this scheme we were to gain hands-on technical experience in a practice of our choice, whilst also having the option to complete a BSc in Applied Computing.\n\nI was fortunate enough to find a position in the largest commercial project BAE Applied Intelligence had had up to that point, Lloyd\'s Register. Here I worked as a AngularJS developer in one of many squads totaling 60+ developers and testers. I took every opportunity I had to grow as a Developer and Scrum team member. As time passed and the project progressed, the teams shrunk and I became the acting lead front-end developer supporting and guiding three junior developers at the start of their careers.\n\nAfter many years I felt it important for me to move on from BAE to progress my career in the direction I wanted.',

    description: 'In June 2021 I joined AND Digital as a Product Developer where I would gain extensive experience in React and React Native. Alongside running internal React training and coding initiatives to help develop the skills of my fellow ANDis, I joined my AND Club\'s largest client, Sky.\n\nWorking on their Customer Hub team where I helped develop the tv/hub section of Sky.com, I was introduced to working in a very data drive mindset. Alongside creating new features we continually ran A/B testing to improve the experience of customers and increase the sales of Sky products.\n\nWorking on Sky.com was an incredible opportunity for me to develop further as a React developer, whilst also working for an innovative company such as Sky alongside generous colleagues.',

    description: 'After my success on Sky.com I was asked to transition over to another Sky project that was currently finding its feet, MSA v3. MSA v3 is the 3rd iteration of the My Sky App and was to be a feature parity application to be built in React Native. Initially I joined a Scrum team that\'s goal was to focus on developing the TV Tab alongside creating reusable components that will be used app-wide.\n\nAfter my extensive experience with Content Stack, Sky\'s CMS of choice, I was heavily involved in shaping and managing the Content for many squads. Over the course of my time on MSA I\'ve had the pleasure of working throughout the codebase and being involved in many challenging tasks. MSA is very much a data driven application that strives to provide customers with a personalised experience. Using Adobe Target I\'ve been involved with creating personalised components and experiences for customers.',
